# Graphs

## Graph

- A collenction of nodes called **vertices** that might be related.
- Relations between vertices are called **edges**.

- An example of a real world graph would be friendships on a social network. Vertices are users, friendships between users are edges.
- A city map is also a graph, where cities are verticies, and roads between each are edges.

## Graph Cycle

- A cycle occurs in a graph when three or more vertices in the graph are connected in a closed loop.

## Acyclic Graph and Cyclic Graph

- **Acyclic** = 0 cycles. **Cyclic** = at least one cycle.

## Directed Graph

- A graph whose edges can be only traversed in one direction, which is specified.
- An example would be a graph of airports and flights. Flights go from one airport to another without implying the presence of a return flight.

## Undirected Graph

- A graph whose edges can be traversed in both directions.
- A graph of friends would be undirected, as friendships are bidirectional.

## Connected Graph

- A graph is connected if every pair of vertices has a path of one or more edges connecting the given verticles.
