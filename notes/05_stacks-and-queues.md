# Stacks and Queues

## Stack

- An array like data structure whose elements follow **LIFO**: Last in, first out.
- A stack is often compared to a stack of books. The last book thats placed on the top is the first one thats taken off.

- A stack is typically implemented with a **dynamic array** or a **singly linked list**.

### Time Complexity

- Pushing an element onto the stack: O(1)
- Popping an element onto the stack: O(1)
- Peeking at the element on the top the stack: O(1)
- Searching for an element in the stack: O(1)

## Queues

- An array like data structure whose elements follow **FIFO**: First in, first out.
- Often compared to a line up people. First in line gets to access first.

- A queue is typically implemented with a **doubly linked list**.

### Time Complexity.

- Enqueuing an element into the queue: O(1)
- Dequeuing an element out of the queue: O(1)
- Peeking at the leement at the front of the queue: O(1)
- Searching for an element in the queue: O(n)
